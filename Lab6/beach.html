        <p>Let's go to the beach beach! It was time to get away for spring break and the only reset that I need is the sand under my feet. The bad thing was that Miami was freezing unfortunately. But we still toughed it out and my brother still managed to get a sunburn! We took this trip as a birthday present for myself and I was able to have the best time plus got to bond a little bit more with my brother along the way!</p>

        <p>My brother, Evan, was so nervous because this was his first ever plane ride somewhere. Funny story is that when you fly SouthWest you get to choose your seats. Long story short, we are broke so we couldn't choose to sit next to each other. Evan was just chilling by himself, but luckily he ended up liking flying! Look at that!</p>

        <p>The hotel that we stayed at had the best heated pool and we just hung out underneath the palm trees relaxing. Another plus was that we were super close to the beach. The bad thing, I got schooled in beach volleyball. We are both super competitive but the sand got the best of me. Apparently Evan thinks he's the next jock of the beach. I will get him next time!</p>
