        <h2>Trips of a Lifetime!</h2>
            <p>People think of trips as vacations or things that are mandatory for work, etc. To me every trip I have been on has been an experience. From traveling abroad in Spain and Portugal,to hiking up the mountains of Colorado, or laying under the hot sun of Miami, there was so much to do and new people to meet! There is no way that I could choose a favorite since each experience had a different meaning to me. This run down will let you see a glimpse of what traveling with Kenzie really is about!</p>
