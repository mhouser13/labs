        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/illinois.jpeg" alt="State of Illinois outline" width="500">
        <p>I am from a small town outside of Springfield, Illinois and have practically been living in a corn field all my life. As a Midwestern girl, I have been able to live and breathe the country lifestyle which has followed me through my childhood. After 18 years of living out in the boondocks (well it seems that way) I have set my sights on becoming the city girl that I have always dreamed of becoming! I come from a supportive family of 4,growing up with a: younger brother, a math whiz dad, and a shopaholic mom. My greatest influence, my mom, has blessed me with a shopping problem and a business mindset. On this blog you will witness all kinds of different interest varying from life updates to daily fit checks! I can't wait to get started!'</p>
