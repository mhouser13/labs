        <p>Fashion has been a part of my life since I was basically born. My mom owns her own clothing consignment boutique and has owned it for 21 years! I remember all the memories of me working the front desk or helping out customers. I could barely see over the counter!</p>
        <p>Today, you will rarely see me wear sweatpants ever as well as me telling you my go-to phrase: "look good,feel good". This mantra is something that I think is essential for every woman out there. We all have those days where we feel absolutely awful. You put on a cute fit and slap on some makeup, you can't tell me you don't feel like a new woman after that! I have started using my social media, to showcase some of these OOTD's and to be honest, I don't think I will be able to stop.</p>
        <p>Why will I not be able to stop?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The confidence I get is unmatched!</li>
            <li>It encourages others to post and share ideas!</li>
            <li>I love giving girls some inspo everyday!</li>
            <li>Interacting with my people is something that I love to do everyday!</li>
            <li>It's a thing that I enjoy to do!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So next time you have an outfit that deserves a moment, post it! You won't regret it!</p>
